# JavaScript Array Exercises

1. Create an array called `fruits` with three favorite fruits.

2. Add a new fruit to the end of the `fruits` array using the `push()` method.

3. Remove the last fruit from the `fruits` array using the `pop()` method and store it in a variable called `lastFruit`.

4. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5. Then, use `console.log()` to print the third element of this array.

5. Change the second element of your `fruits` array to "kiwi".

6. Create an empty array called `colors`. Then add "red", "green", and "blue" to it using the `push()` method.

7. Remove the first element from your `colors` array using the `shift()` method.

8. Add "yellow" to the beginning of your `colors` array using the `unshift()` method.

9. Create an array of numbers and use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.

10. Use the `indexOf()` method to find the position of "green" in your `colors` array.

11. Create an array of five random numbers. Then use a `for` loop to find and console.log the largest number in the array.

12. Use the `slice()` method to create a new array containing the second and third elements of your `fruits` array.

13. Create an array of numbers. Use the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only the even numbers.

14. Use the `join()` method to convert your `colors` array into a string where colors are separated by commas.

15. Create two arrays of numbers. Use the `concat()` method to combine them into a single array.

16. Use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of elements in your `fruits` array.

17. Create an array of names. Use the `map()` method to create a new array where each name is prefixed with "Hello, ".

18. Use the `every()` method to check if all numbers in an array are greater than 0.

19. Create an array of numbers. Use the `find()` method to get the first number greater than 10.

20. Use the `some()` method to check if your `fruits` array contains the fruit "banana".

21. Create an array of numbers. Use the `reduce()` method to calculate the product of all numbers in the array.

22. Use a `for` loop to create an array containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

23. Create an array of words. Use the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only words with more than 5 letters.

24. Use the `includes()` method to check if your `colors` array includes the color "purple".

25. Create a 2D array representing a tic-tac-toe board. Fill it with "X", "O", and empty strings. Then, write a function that console.logs the board in a readable format.

Remember to test your code and experiment with different inputs!
