# Additional JavaScript Loops Exercises

1. Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 20.

2. Create a while loop that prints odd numbers from 1 to 15.

3. Use a do...while loop to ask the user for a number between 1 and 10 until they enter a valid number.

4. Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

5. Create a while loop that prints a countdown from 10 to "Blast off!".

6. Use a for loop to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

7. Write a do...while loop that generates random numbers between 1 and 6 (simulating a die roll) until it rolls a 3.

8. Create a for loop that prints the multiplication table for the number 7 (up to 10).

9. Use a while loop to find the first number greater than 1000 that is divisible by both 3 and 7.

10. Write a for loop that calculates the factorial of a given number.

11. Create a do...while loop that asks the user to guess a secret number between 1 and 20, giving "higher" or "lower" hints.

12. Use a for loop to check if a given number is prime.

13. Write a while loop that converts a decimal number to its binary representation.

14. Create a for loop that prints a triangle pattern of numbers:
    ```
    1
    22
    333
    4444
    55555
    ```

15. Use a do...while loop to implement a simple calculator that performs operations until the user chooses to exit.

16. Write a for loop that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

17. Create a while loop that implements the Caesar cipher for a given string and shift value.

18. Use a for loop to print the first n numbers in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...

19. Write a do...while loop that simulates flipping a coin until it lands on heads 3 times in a row.

20. Create a for loop that calculates the sum of the squares of numbers from 1 to n.

21. Use a while loop to find the smallest number of terms in the series 1 + 2 + 3 + ... that exceeds a given value.

22. Write a for loop that prints a diamond pattern of asterisks.

23. Create a do...while loop that implements a guessing game where the computer tries to guess a number the user is thinking of.

24. Use a for loop to calculate the sum of the series: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... for n terms.

25. Write a while loop that simulates the Collatz conjecture: start with a number n, if it's even, divide it by 2, if it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat until you reach 1.

Remember to use only concepts that have been covered so far, focusing on loops and basic arithmetic operations!
